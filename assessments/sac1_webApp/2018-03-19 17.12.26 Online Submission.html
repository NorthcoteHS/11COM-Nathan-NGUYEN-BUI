<p>Hey Mr.Koopmans</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my reflection for the SAC, sorry I forgot to hand it in last week. Alongside the booklet.</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>The planning process helped me further elaborate my broad ideas of what I wanted to create. And helped me towards a decisive decision, it also gave me a visual representation of what I wanted to achieve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My design surprisingly didn&#39;t alter at all, it was more of like a set goal with obstacles in far reach. Everything mainly stayed the same, from start to finish.</p>

<p>The most challenging part of the application was actually the Javascript, and how i was going to utilise that to make everything work together, function correctly, etc. In the end I couldn&#39;t actually find most of the things i was looking for, or couldn&#39;t break down complicated processes. Meaning that my Javascript wasn&#39;t completely finished. Everything else like the graphics, html, and css were easy peasy.</p>

<p>I think the aesthetic part of it, every visual element clicked into place and that made it very visually appealing.</p>

<p>That computing is hard, and that i need to put more effort into my next project for it to be successful, as there are many obstacles awaiting my computing/programming journey ahead of me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Be more organised and time efficient, by far that is the key factor. I would have organised this and found possibly a more viable method of alternatively producing my client.</p>
